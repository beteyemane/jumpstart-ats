# Jumpstart Case Study

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## Jumpstart ATS
The brief was to come up with a design to help startups streamline their recruitment processes. The goal was to create a simple, intuitive system that allows to effectively manage candidate progression.

## Key Features:
Drag & Drop Interface: The ATS includes a drag & drop interface with default columns such as "Applied", "1st Round Interview", "Offer", and "Rejected". This allows users to easily move candidates through the stages, ensuring a smooth workflow and faster decision making.

## Customisable Columns: 
Users can add or remove columns to tailor the workflow to suit the needs of their organisation.

## Candidate Overview: 
A “view more” feature allows users to expand a candidate’s profile to view additional details. This helps teams to quickly assess all candidates at a glance, and then dig deeper into the profiles of the candidates they are interested in. This functionality is aimed at improving speed and accuracy in reviewing applicants without overwhelming users with unnecessary information.

## Notes 
Pop-up: Users can click on the notes icon to open a pop-up and add or view notes about candidates. I didn't have enough time to complete the functionality for this feature, but hopefully you can visualise how it could allow users easily capture and review key insights about candidates.

## If I had more time:
Editable Column Names: I would implement the ability to edit column names, allowing the ATS to be even more flexible and suited to the specific needs of each organisation.

## Notes Functionality: 
I would complete the notes section, ensuring it fully integrates into the candidate workflow and makes it easier to track candidate-specific feedback and updates.

## Styling: 
Further work would be done on the styling and user interface, aiming to enhance the overall user experience and provide a more polished and professional design.
